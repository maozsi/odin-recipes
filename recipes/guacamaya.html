        snack that can quickly evolve into a full meal, there are those based on a piece of
        bread called <em>"bolillo"</em>. Said dishes are basically a sandwich, however, depending on the 
        ingredients, seasoning, and craft style of the one preparing the samich, you could end  
        with a great variety of flavors even with the same elements.
